To run this, just copy the path of the html file onto your favourite browser.

Intro to the DOM
- DOM stands for DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL. It is created by the browser once it finishes reading an html file.
REPL/devTools console
- What is REPL? It stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop. Basically its an interactive language shell.
Window Object/ Navigator Object
- Each tab in a browser is a window with its own window object.
- Navigator is the browser. I.E Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc. Contains information about the browser such as browser version, browser name, geographic location
What is the DOM and how does it work?
- The browser reads html files from top to bottom, while creating DOM nodes. The Document Object Model is a type of tree.
Event Object & Event Handling
- The Event object contains useful information about the specific event that occurred, where it occured, how it occured, etc.
- Each event is represented by an Event object which is passed as the argument to the callback function

- Intro to jQuery
What is the jQuery and how does it work?
- jQuery is a fast, small and feature-rich Javascript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an east to use API that works across a bunch of browsers.
Why do we need it?
- jQuery is a library that allows you to cut down on syntax.
Does it add any benefit to us?
- It introduces us to the idea of event handling, and DOM manipulation.
Event Handling with jQuery
- The event object has different keys than the regular Event object, but the values will remain the same. (i.e. mouse position)
